						<h2>Who It's For</h2>
						<p>OverTone is a creative tool for musicians and composers.</p>
					</header>
<footer style="text-align: justify;">
Aspiring musicians can now play their favorite songs, without the difficult and tedious process of transcribing by hand. With OverTone, transcription is as simple as tapping along to an audio recording. This makes transcription more accessible to musicians who are still developing their musical ear, and saves time for more experienced players. <br><br> OverTone also accelerates the musical composition process, allowing composers to instantly transfer ideas from their fingers to the page. Now, composers can focus more on what they do best - making music.

						<h2>How It Works</h2>
						<p>OverTone applies motion analysis, frequency analysis, and advanced filtering algorithms to transcribe music.</p>
					</header>
									<footer>
						<p>OverTone collects two sets of data from the user: accelerometer data, from a phone on their foot, and an audio recording.</p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="AccelGraph.jpg" align="right" style="width:360px; height:240px">The first thing OverTone looks at is the accerometer data. This acts as a map between time in seconds and time in "beats," and allows our application to differentiate between note lengths in a form useful to musicians. To do this, OverTone looks for sharp spikes in vertical acceleration in the phone's coordinate system, which occur when your foot impacts the ground. Because these readings are recorded at the same time as the audio, it allows OverTone to "keep the beat" - even as the user changes tempo.<br><br><br></p></div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="STFTGraph.jpg" align="left" style="width:360px; height:240px">After the beat profile is taken, OverTone samples short audio segments to analyze their pitch. For each of these samples, we use Fourier analysis to find the fundamental pitch, which generally appears as a spike at the corresponding frequency. <br><br> To get a clean result, our application has to differentiate between the actual played frequency and overtones of that note. These overtones appear as regularly-spaced spikes in the frequency graph above the fundamental pitch; our algorithm only looks at the first peak.</p></div><br>
